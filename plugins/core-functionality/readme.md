# Core Functionality Plugin

This plugin is used to house all non-theme related functionality including, but not limited to, custom post types, taxonomies and acf blocks.  This is necessary to ensure core functionality is flexible to be used when theme changes are required.


## Usage

The plugin comes pre-packages with basic setup for post type, taxonomy and ACF blocks setup.  For more information on plugin usage visit plugin wiki:
